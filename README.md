# StupidStateIDNumberGenerator
generator for numbers that are definitely not national ID numbers so it's ok that they are totally insecure and generated and assigned to everyone individually by a braindead algorithm created 90 years ago and 5% of all possible combinations have been assigned because they are not national ID numbers
